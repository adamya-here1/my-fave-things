    <p>
      Rocket League is a fantastical sport-based video game (it's “soccer with
      cars”). It features a competitive game mode based on teamwork and
      outmaneuvering opponents. Players work with their team to advance the ball
      down the field, and score goals in their opponents' net. There are many
      things that make this my all-time favourite game, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having fun with my buddies</li>
      <li>Never-ending scope to improve your skills</li>
      <li>*sarcastic* Not toxic community</li>
    </ul>
